# Speedrun Accomplishments

Note: this page does not contain a full list of my speedruns. For more information, check my [speedrun.com profile](https://www.speedrun.com/user/RileyTech).

## Super Mario Flash

I was the first person to achieve a time under 8 minutes and 20 seconds (without glitches) in *Super Mario Flash*, and I hold multiple records in individual levels.

## Zero Escape Series

I am the first person to perform a speedrun of all three games in the *Zero Escape* series (*Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors*, *Virtue's Last Reward*, and *Zero Time Dilemma*) back-to-back, with a time just under 9 hours. I currently hold the world record, with a time of 6:53:22.

## Gameband: The Heist (Minecraft map)

I currently hold world record in all categories of *The Heist*, but the time that I'm most proud of is my sub-10 minute run (using real time) of the "All Floors" category.
